The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps stated in the description of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

0. Read the data into

        features (561 rows, 2 columns)
        activities (6 rows, 2 columns)
        x_test (2947 rows, 561 columns)
        x_train (7352 rows, 561 columns)
        y_test (2947 rows, 1 column)
        y_train (7352 rows, 1 column)
        subject_test (2947 rows, 1 column)
        subject_train (7352 rows, 1 column)
        

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set which is called data
        x (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using the rbind() function
        y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using the rbind() function
        subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test the using rbind() function
        data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging subject, y and X using cbind() function

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
        data (10299 rows, 88 columns) is updated by subsetting, more precisely by selecting the following columns: subject, classLabels and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement
        which are identified by "mean" or "std"

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        Each number in classLabels column of the data was replaced by corresponding activity name(string). The mapping was done by using the activity_labels

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
        - The code column was renamed into Activities
        - All subject in column’s name were replaced by Subject
        - All angle in column’s name werw replaced by Angle
        - All gravity in column’s name were replaced by Gravity
        - All Acc in column’s name were replaced by Accelerometer
        - All Gyro in column’s name were replaced by Gyroscope
        - All Mag in column’s name were replaced by Magnitude
        - All starts with character f in column’s name were replaced by Frequency
        - All starts with character t in column’s name were replaced by Time
        - All tBody in column’s name were replaced by Body
        - All mean with optional (-) in front in column’s name were replaced by Mean
        - All std with optional (-) in front in column’s name were replaced by Std
        - All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
        - All "." in column’s name were removed
        
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

tidyData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by grouping data by Subject and Activity and subsequently by summarizing data taking the means of each variable for each subject and each activity
        
6.  Export tidyData into tidyData.txt file
